## Mac-OS
 ### To download macOS from the App Store, you must download from a Mac that is compatible with that macOS. If your Mac isn't compatible, the App Store dims the Get button, says that the macOS is not compatible with this device, or says that the requested version of macOS is not available.
 ### 1. Use these links to find macOS in the App Store. If these links don't work as expected, try again using Safari, which is in your Applications folder.
 ### 2. Click the Get button in the App Store to begin downloading. Software Update might open and ask you to download from there.
 ### 3. After downloading to your Applications folder, the installer opens automatically. Follow the onscreen installation instructions. Or quit without installing to leave the installer in your Applications folder for later use.
