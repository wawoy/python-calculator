# Intallation
## Windows
## If you wish to install Windows 10 on your PC, you are coming to the right place. In this post, we will show you how to install Windows 10 step by step with pictures. 
## Step 1. Check Requirements for Installing Windows 10
### First and foremost, you should ensure your PC meets the minimum Windows 10 system requirements. For that, you should go to Microsoft's official site for reference. You can perform the steps below if the computer meets the minimum requirements.
## Step 2. Create a Backup
### If your computer is not new, before starting the Windows 10 installation process, it's vital to back up your files. Under such circumstances, you can use professional backup software, like EaseUS Todo Backup, to back up your files to an external drive, cloud, or USB drive. This is important because installation might erase the data on your computer's hard drive.




## Mac-OS
 ### To download macOS from the App Store, you must download from a Mac that is compatible with that macOS. If your Mac isn't compatible, the App Store dims the Get button, says that the macOS is not compatible with this device, or says that the requested version of macOS is not available.
 ### 1. Use these links to find macOS in the App Store. If these links don't work as expected, try again using Safari, which is in your Applications folder.
 ### 2. Click the Get button in the App Store to begin downloading. Software Update might open and ask you to download from there.
 ### 3. After downloading to your Applications folder, the installer opens automatically. Follow the onscreen installation instructions. Or quit without installing to leave the installer in your Applications folder for later use.
